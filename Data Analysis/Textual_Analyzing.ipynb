    "El objetivo principal de este notebook es obtener una visión general del Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural (Natural Language Processing - NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP comprende el preprocesamiento de textos, el análisis de sentimientos y la similitud de textos utilizando NLTK y SpaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "En la era de la información, los datos se producen a velocidades y volúmenes increíbles. Los datos producidos no sólo son de tipo estructurado o tabular, sino que también pueden ser de diversos tipos no estructurados, como datos textuales, datos de imágenes o gráficos, datos de voz y video.\n",
    "\n",
    "El texto es un tipo de datos muy común y rico. Los artículos, los blogs, los tutoriales, las publicaciones en las redes sociales y el contenido de los sitios web producen datos textuales no estructurados. La gente envía miles de correos electrónicos, mensajes, comentarios y tweets cada minuto. Esta gran cantidad de datos textuales necesita ser explotada. La analítica de textos ofrece muchas oportunidades a las empresas; por ejemplo, Amazon puede interpretar los comentarios de los clientes sobre un determinado producto, los analistas de noticias pueden analizar las tendencias de las noticias y los últimos temas en Twitter, y Netflix también puede interpretar las críticas de cada película y serie. \n",
    "\n",
    "Temas que se cubrirán en este notebook: operaciones básicas de análisis de texto, como la tokenización, la eliminación de palabras vacías (stopwords), el stemming, la lematización, el etiquetado PoS y el reconocimiento de entidades. Se profundizará en entender las opiniones de los clientes sobre un producto basándonos en las reseñas, utilizando el análisis de sentimientos. En este caso, realizaremos el análisis de sentimientos mediante la clasificación de textos y evaluaremos el rendimiento del modelo mediante la exactitud, la precisión, el recuerdo y la puntuación f1. Por último, nos centraremos en la similitud del texto entre dos frases utilizando la similitud de Jaccard y del coseno."

An open Place. Thunder and Lightning. Enter three Witches.FIRST WITCH.When shall we three meet again?In thunder lightning or in rain?SECOND WITCH.When the hurlyburly’s doneWhen the battle’s lost and won.THIRD WITCH.That will be ere the set of sun.FIRST WITCH.Where the place?SECOND WITCH.Upon the heath.THIRD WITCH.There to meet with Macbeth.FIRST WITCH.I come Graymalkin!SECOND WITCH.Paddock calls.THIRD WITCH.Anon.ALL.Fair is foul and foul is fair:Hover through the fog and filthy air. [_Exeunt._]SCENE II. A Camp near Forres. Alarum within. Enter King Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Lennox with Attendants meeting a bleeding Captain.DUNCAN.What bloody man is that? He can reportAs seemeth by his plight of the revoltThe newest state.MALCOLM.This is the sergeantWho like a good and hardy soldier fought’Gainst my captivity.—Hail brave friend!Say to the King the knowledge of the broilAs thou didst leave it.SOLDIER.Doubtful it stood;As two spent swimmers that do cling togetherAnd choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald(Worthy to be a rebel for to thatThe multiplying villainies of natureDo swarm upon him) from the Western IslesOf kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;And Fortune on his damned quarrel smilingShow’d like a rebel’s whore. But all’s too weak;For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name)Disdaining Fortune with his brandish’d steelWhich smok’d with bloody executionLike Valour’s minion carv’d out his passageTill he fac’d the slave;Which ne’er shook hands nor bade farewell to himTill he unseam’d him from the nave to the chopsAnd fix’d his head upon our battlements.DUNCAN.O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!SOLDIER.As whence the sun ’gins his reflectionShipwracking storms and direful thunders breakSo from that spring whence comfort seem’d to comeDiscomfort swells. Mark King of Scotland mark:No sooner justice had with valour arm’dCompell’d these skipping kerns to trust their heelsBut the Norweyan lord surveying vantageWith furbish’d arms and new supplies of menBegan a fresh assault.DUNCAN.Dismay’d not thisOur captains Macbeth and Banquo?SOLDIER.Yes;As sparrows eagles or the hare the lion.If I say sooth I must report they wereAs cannons overcharg’d with double cracks;So theyDoubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:Except they meant to bathe in reeking woundsOr memorize another GolgothaI cannot tell—But I am faint my gashes cry for help.DUNCAN.So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:They smack of honour both.—Go get him surgeons. [_Exit Captain attended._] Enter Ross and Angus.Who comes here?MALCOLM.The worthy Thane of Ross.LENNOX.What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he lookThat seems to speak things strange.ROSS.God save the King!DUNCAN.Whence cam’st thou worthy thane?ROSS.From Fife great KingWhere the Norweyan banners flout the skyAnd fan our people cold.Norway himself with terrible numbersAssisted by that most disloyal traitorThe Thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict;Till that Bellona’s bridegroom lapp’d in proofConfronted him with self-comparisonsPoint against point rebellious arm ’gainst armCurbing his lavish spirit: and to concludeThe victory fell on us.DUNCAN.Great happiness!ROSS.That nowSweno the Norways’ king craves composition;Nor would we deign him burial of his menTill he disbursed at Saint Colme’s InchTen thousand dollars to our general use.DUNCAN.No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiveOur bosom interest. Go pronounce his present deathAnd with his former title greet Macbeth.ROSS.I’ll see it done.DUNCAN.What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won. [_Exeunt._]SCENE III. A heath. Thunder. Enter the three Witches.FIRST WITCH.Where hast thou been sister?SECOND WITCH.Killing swine.THIRD WITCH.Sister where thou?FIRST WITCH.A sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lapAnd mounch’d and mounch’d and mounch’d. “Give me” quoth I.“Aroint thee witch!” the rump-fed ronyon cries.Her husband’s to Aleppo gone master o’ th’ _Tiger:_But in a sieve I’ll thither sailAnd like a rat without a tailI’ll do I’ll do and I’ll do.SECOND WITCH.I’ll give thee a wind.FIRST WITCH.Th’art kind.THIRD WITCH.And I another.FIRST WITCH.I myself have all the otherAnd the very ports they blowAll the quarters that they knowI’ the shipman’s card.I will drain him dry as hay:Sleep shall neither night nor dayHang upon his pent-house lid;He shall live a man forbid.Weary sev’n-nights nine times nineShall he dwindle peak and pine:Though his bark cannot be lostYet it shall be tempest-tost.Look what I have.SECOND WITCH.Show me show me.FIRST WITCH.Here I have a pilot’s thumbWrack’d as homeward he did come. [_Drum within._]THIRD WITCH.A drum a drum!Macbeth doth come.ALL.The Weird Sisters hand in handPosters of the sea and landThus do go about about:Thrice to thine and thrice to mineAnd thrice again to make up nine.Peace!—the charm’s wound up. Enter Macbeth and Banquo.MACBETH.So foul and fair a day I have not seen.BANQUO.How far is’t call’d to Forres?—What are theseSo wither’d and so wild in their attireThat look not like the inhabitants o’ th’ earthAnd yet are on’t?—Live you? or are you aughtThat man may question? You seem to understand meBy each at once her choppy finger layingUpon her skinny lips. You should be womenAnd yet your beards forbid me to interpretThat you are so.MACBETH.Speak if you can;—what are you?FIRST WITCH.All hail Macbeth! hail to thee Thane of Glamis!SECOND WITCH.All hail Macbeth! hail to thee Thane of Cawdor!THIRD WITCH.All hail Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!BANQUO.Good sir why do you start and seem to fearThings that do sound so fair?—I’ th’ name of truthAre ye fantastical or that indeedWhich outwardly ye show? My noble partnerYou greet with present grace and great predictionOf noble having and of royal hopeThat he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.If you can look into the seeds of timeAnd say which grain will grow and which will notSpeak then to me who neither beg nor fearYour favours nor your hate.FIRST WITCH.Hail!SECOND WITCH.Hail!THIRD WITCH.Hail!FIRST WITCH.Lesser than Macbeth and greater.SECOND WITCH.Not so happy yet much happier.THIRD WITCH.Thou shalt get kings though thou be none:So all hail Macbeth and Banquo!FIRST WITCH.Banquo and Macbeth all hail!MACBETH.Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more.By Sinel’s death I know I am Thane of Glamis;But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor livesA prosperous gentleman; and to be kingStands not within the prospect of beliefNo more than to be Cawdor. Say from whenceYou owe this strange intelligence? or whyUpon this blasted heath you stop our wayWith such prophetic greeting?—Speak I charge you. [_Witches vanish._]BANQUO.The earth hath bubbles as the water hasAnd these are of them. Whither are they vanish’d?MACBETH.Into the air; and what seem’d corporalMelted as breath into the wind.Would they had stay’d!BANQUO.Were such things here as we do speak about?Or have we eaten on the insane rootThat takes the reason prisoner?MACBETH.Your children shall be kings.BANQUO.You shall be king.MACBETH.And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?BANQUO.To the selfsame tune and words. Who’s here? Enter Ross and Angus.ROSS.The King hath happily receiv’d MacbethThe news of thy success and when he readsThy personal venture in the rebels’ fightHis wonders and his praises do contendWhich should be thine or his: silenc’d with thatIn viewing o’er the rest o’ th’ selfsame dayHe finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranksNothing afeard of what thyself didst makeStrange images of death. As thick as taleCame post with post; and everyone did bearThy praises in his kingdom’s great defenceAnd pour’d them down before him.ANGUS.We are sentTo give thee from our royal master thanks;Only to herald thee into his sightNot pay thee.ROSS.And for an earnest of a greater honourHe bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor:In which addition hail most worthy thaneFor it is thine.BANQUO.What can the devil speak true?MACBETH.The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress meIn borrow’d robes?ANGUS.Who was the Thane lives yetBut under heavy judgement bears that lifeWhich he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin’dWith those of Norway or did line the rebelWith hidden help and vantage or that with bothHe labour’d in his country’s wrack I know not;But treasons capital confess’d and prov’dHave overthrown him.MACBETH.[_Aside._] Glamis and Thane of Cawdor:The greatest is behind. [_To Ross and Angus._] Thanks for your pains.[_To Banquo._] Do you not hope your children shall be kingsWhen those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to mePromis’d no less to them?BANQUO.That trusted homeMight yet enkindle you unto the crownBesides the Thane of Cawdor. But ’tis strange:And oftentimes to win us to our harmThe instruments of darkness tell us truths;Win us with honest trifles to betray’sIn deepest consequence.—Cousins a word I pray you.MACBETH.[_Aside._] Two truths are toldAs happy prologues to the swelling actOf the imperial theme.—I thank you gentlemen.—[_Aside._] This supernatural solicitingCannot be ill; cannot be good. If illWhy hath it given me earnest of successCommencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:If good why do I yield to that suggestionWhose horrid image doth unfix my hairAnd make my seated heart knock at my ribsAgainst the use of nature? Present fearsAre less than horrible imaginings.My thought whose murder yet is but fantasticalShakes so my single state of manThat function is smother’d in surmiseAnd nothing is but what is not.BANQUO.Look how our partner’s rapt.MACBETH.[_Aside._] If chance will have me king why chance may crown meWithout my stir.BANQUO.New honours come upon himLike our strange garments cleave not to their mouldBut with the aid of use.MACBETH.[_Aside._] Come what come mayTime and the hour runs through the roughest day.BANQUO.Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure.MACBETH.Give me your favour. My dull brain was wroughtWith things forgotten. Kind gentlemen your painsAre register’d where every day I turnThe leaf to read them.—Let us toward the King.—Think upon what hath chanc’d; and at more timeThe interim having weigh’d it let us speakOur free hearts each to other.BANQUO.Very gladly.MACBETH.Till then enough.—Come friends. [_Exeunt._]SCENE IV. Forres. A Room in the Palace. Flourish. Enter Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Lennox and Attendants.DUNCAN.Is execution done on Cawdor? Are notThose in commission yet return’d?MALCOLM.My liegeThey are not yet come back. But I have spokeWith one that saw him die who did reportThat very frankly he confess’d his treasonsImplor’d your Highness’ pardon and set forthA deep repentance. Nothing in his lifeBecame him like the leaving it; he diedAs one that had been studied in his deathTo throw away the dearest thing he ow’dAs ’twere a careless trifle.DUNCAN.There’s no artTo find the mind’s construction in the face:He was a gentleman on whom I builtAn absolute trust. Enter Macbeth Banquo Ross and Angus.O worthiest cousin!The sin of my ingratitude even nowWas heavy on me. Thou art so far beforeThat swiftest wing of recompense is slowTo overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv’d;That the proportion both of thanks and paymentMight have been mine! only I have left to sayMore is thy due than more than all can pay.MACBETH.The service and the loyalty I oweIn doing it pays itself. Your Highness’ partIs to receive our duties: and our dutiesAre to your throne and state children and servants;Which do but what they should by doing everythingSafe toward your love and honour.DUNCAN.Welcome hither:I have begun to plant thee and will labourTo make thee full of growing.—Noble BanquoThat hast no less deserv’d nor must be knownNo less to have done so let me infold theeAnd hold thee to my heart.BANQUO.There if I growThe harvest is your own.DUNCAN.My plenteous joysWanton in fulness seek to hide themselvesIn drops of sorrow.—Sons kinsmen thanesAnd you whose places are the nearest knowWe will establish our estate uponOur eldest Malcolm; whom we name hereafterThe Prince of Cumberland: which honour mustNot unaccompanied invest him onlyBut signs of nobleness like stars shall shineOn all deservers.—From hence to InvernessAnd bind us further to you.MACBETH.The rest is labour which is not us’d for you:I’ll be myself the harbinger and make joyfulThe hearing of my wife with your approach;So humbly take my leave.DUNCAN.My worthy Cawdor!MACBETH.[_Aside._] The Prince of Cumberland!—That is a stepOn which I must fall down or else o’erleapFor in my way it lies. Stars hide your fires!Let not light see my black and deep desires.The eye wink at the hand yet let that beWhich the eye fears when it is done to see. [_Exit._]DUNCAN.True worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant;And in his commendations I am fed.It is a banquet to me. Let’s after himWhose care is gone before to bid us welcome:It is a peerless kinsman. [_Flourish. Exeunt._]SCENE V. Inverness. A Room in Macbeth’s Castle. Enter Lady Macbeth reading a letter.LADY MACBETH.“They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by theperfect’st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When Iburned in desire to question them further they made themselves airinto which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it camemissives from the King who all-hailed me ‘Thane of Cawdor’; by whichtitle before these Weird Sisters saluted me and referred me to thecoming on of time with ‘Hail king that shalt be!’ This have I thoughtgood to deliver thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thoumight’st not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of whatgreatness is promis’d thee. Lay it to thy heart and farewell.”Glamis thou art and Cawdor; and shalt beWhat thou art promis’d. Yet do I fear thy nature;It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindnessTo catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;Art not without ambition but withoutThe illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highlyThat wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play falseAnd yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou’dst have great GlamisThat which cries “Thus thou must do” if thou have it;And that which rather thou dost fear to doThan wishest should be undone. Hie thee hitherThat I may pour my spirits in thine earAnd chastise with the valour of my tongueAll that impedes thee from the golden roundWhich fate and metaphysical aid doth seemTo have thee crown’d withal. Enter a Messenger.What is your tidings?MESSENGER.The King comes here tonight.LADY MACBETH.Thou’rt mad to say it.Is not thy master with him? who were’t soWould have inform’d for preparation.MESSENGER.So please you it is true. Our thane is coming.One of my fellows had the speed of himWho almost dead for breath had scarcely moreThan would make up his message.LADY MACBETH.Give him tending.He brings great news. [_Exit Messenger._]The raven himself is hoarseThat croaks the fatal entrance of DuncanUnder my battlements. Come you spiritsThat tend on mortal thoughts unsex me hereAnd fill me from the crown to the toe top-fullOf direst cruelty! make thick my bloodStop up th’ access and passage to remorseThat no compunctious visitings of natureShake my fell purpose nor keep peace betweenTh’ effect and it! Come to my woman’s breastsAnd take my milk for gall your murd’ring ministersWherever in your sightless substancesYou wait on nature’s mischief! Come thick nightAnd pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hellThat my keen knife see not the wound it makesNor heaven peep through the blanket of the darkTo cry “Hold hold!” Enter Macbeth.Great Glamis worthy Cawdor!Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter!Thy letters have transported me beyondThis ignorant present and I feel nowThe future in the instant.MACBETH.My dearest loveDuncan comes here tonight.LADY MACBETH.And when goes hence?MACBETH.Tomorrow as he purposes.LADY MACBETH.O neverShall sun that morrow see!Your face my thane is as a book where menMay read strange matters. To beguile the timeLook like the time; bear welcome in your eyeYour hand your tongue: look like the innocent flowerBut be the serpent under’t. He that’s comingMust be provided for; and you shall putThis night’s great business into my dispatch;Which shall to all our nights and days to comeGive solely sovereign sway and masterdom.MACBETH.We will speak further.LADY MACBETH.Only look up clear;To alter favour ever is to fear.Leave all the rest to me. [_Exeunt._]SCENE VI. The same. Before the Castle. Hautboys. Servants of Macbeth attending. Enter Duncan Malcolm Donalbain Banquo Lennox Macduff Ross Angus and Attendants.DUNCAN.This castle hath a pleasant seat. The airNimbly and sweetly recommends itselfUnto our gentle senses.BANQUO.This guest of summerThe temple-haunting martlet does approveBy his loved mansionry that the heaven’s breathSmells wooingly here: no jutty friezeButtress nor coign of vantage but this birdhath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle.Where they most breed and haunt I have observ’dThe air is delicate. Enter Lady Macbeth.DUNCAN.See see our honour’d hostess!—The love that follows us sometime is our troubleWhich still we thank as love. Herein I teach youHow you shall bid God ’ild us for your painsAnd thank us for your trouble.LADY MACBETH.All our serviceIn every point twice done and then done doubleWere poor and single business to contendAgainst those honours deep and broad wherewithYour Majesty loads our house: for those of oldAnd the late dignities heap’d up to themWe rest your hermits.DUNCAN.Where’s the Thane of Cawdor?We cours’d him at the heels and had a purposeTo be his purveyor: but he rides well;And his great love sharp as his spur hath holp himTo his home before us. Fair and noble hostessWe are your guest tonight.LADY MACBETH.Your servants everHave theirs themselves and what is theirs in comptTo make their audit at your Highness’ pleasureStill to return your own.DUNCAN.Give me your hand;Conduct me to mine host: we love him highlyAnd shall continue our graces towards him.By your leave hostess. [_Exeunt._]SCENE VII. The same. A Lobby in the Castle. Hautboys and torches. Enter and pass over a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service. Then enter Macbeth.MACBETH.If it were done when ’tis done then ’twere wellIt were done quickly. If th’ assassinationCould trammel up the consequence and catchWith his surcease success; that but this blowMight be the be-all and the end-all—hereBut here upon this bank and shoal of timeWe’d jump the life to come. But in these casesWe still have judgement here; that we but teachBloody instructions which being taught returnTo plague th’ inventor. This even-handed justiceCommends th’ ingredience of our poison’d chaliceTo our own lips. He’s here in double trust:First as I am his kinsman and his subjectStrong both against the deed; then as his hostWho should against his murderer shut the doorNot bear the knife myself. Besides this DuncanHath borne his faculties so meek hath beenSo clear in his great office that his virtuesWill plead like angels trumpet-tongued againstThe deep damnation of his taking-off;And pity like a naked new-born babeStriding the blast or heaven’s cherubin hors’dUpon the sightless couriers of the airShall blow the horrid deed in every eyeThat tears shall drown the wind.—I have no spurTo prick the sides of my intent but onlyVaulting ambition which o’erleaps itselfAnd falls on th’ other— Enter Lady Macbeth.How now! what news?LADY MACBETH.He has almost supp’d. Why have you left the chamber?MACBETH.Hath he ask’d for me?LADY MACBETH.Know you not he has?MACBETH.We will proceed no further in this business:He hath honour’d me of late; and I have boughtGolden opinions from all sorts of peopleWhich would be worn now in their newest glossNot cast aside so soon.LADY MACBETH.Was the hope drunkWherein you dress’d yourself? Hath it slept since?And wakes it now to look so green and paleAt what it did so freely? From this timeSuch I account thy love. Art thou afeardTo be the same in thine own act and valourAs thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have thatWhich thou esteem’st the ornament of lifeAnd live a coward in thine own esteemLetting “I dare not” wait upon “I would”Like the poor cat i’ th’ adage?MACBETH.Pr’ythee peace!I dare do all that may become a man;Who dares do more is none.LADY MACBETH.What beast was’t thenThat made you break this enterprise to me?When you durst do it then you were a man;And to be more than what you were you wouldBe so much more the man. Nor time nor placeDid then adhere and yet you would make both:They have made themselves and that their fitness nowDoes unmake you. I have given suck and knowHow tender ’tis to love the babe that milks me:I would while it was smiling in my faceHave pluck’d my nipple from his boneless gumsAnd dash’d the brains out had I so sworn as youHave done to this.MACBETH.If we should fail?LADY MACBETH.We fail?But screw your courage to the sticking-placeAnd we’ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep(Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journeySoundly invite him) his two chamberlainsWill I with wine and wassail so convinceThat memory the warder of the brainShall be a fume and the receipt of reasonA limbeck only: when in swinish sleepTheir drenched natures lie as in a deathWhat cannot you and I perform uponTh’ unguarded Duncan? what not put uponHis spongy officers; who shall bear the guiltOf our great quell?MACBETH.Bring forth men-children only;For thy undaunted mettle should composeNothing but males. Will it not be receiv’dWhen we have mark’d with blood those sleepy twoOf his own chamber and us’d their very daggersThat they have done’t?LADY MACBETH.Who dares receive it otherAs we shall make our griefs and clamour roarUpon his death?MACBETH.I am settled and bend upEach corporal agent to this terrible feat.Away and mock the time with fairest show:False face must hide what the false heart doth know. [_Exeunt._]ACT IISCENE I. Inverness. Court within the Castle. Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch before him.BANQUO.How goes the night boy?FLEANCE.The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.BANQUO.And she goes down at twelve.FLEANCE.I take’t ’tis later sir.BANQUO.Hold take my sword.—There’s husbandry in heaven;Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.A heavy summons lies like lead upon meAnd yet I would not sleep. Merciful powersRestrain in me the cursed thoughts that natureGives way to in repose! Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.Give me my sword.—Who’s there?MACBETH.A friend.BANQUO.What sir not yet at rest? The King’s abed:He hath been in unusual pleasure andSent forth great largess to your offices.This diamond he greets your wife withalBy the name of most kind hostess and shut upIn measureless content.MACBETH.Being unprepar’dOur will became the servant to defectWhich else should free have wrought.BANQUO.All’s well.I dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters:To you they have show’d some truth.MACBETH.I think not of them:Yet when we can entreat an hour to serveWe would spend it in some words upon that businessIf you would grant the time.BANQUO.At your kind’st leisure.MACBETH.If you shall cleave to my consent when ’tisIt shall make honour for you.BANQUO.So I lose noneIn seeking to augment it but still keepMy bosom franchis’d and allegiance clearI shall be counsell’d.MACBETH.Good repose the while!BANQUO.Thanks sir: the like to you. [_Exeunt Banquo and Fleance._]MACBETH.Go bid thy mistress when my drink is readyShe strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed. [_Exit Servant._]Is this a dagger which I see before meThe handle toward my hand? Come let me clutch thee:—I have thee not and yet I see thee still.Art thou not fatal vision sensibleTo feeling as to sight? or art thou butA dagger of the mind a false creationProceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?I see thee yet in form as palpableAs this which now I draw.Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going;And such an instrument I was to use.Mine eyes are made the fools o’ the other sensesOr else worth all the rest: I see thee still;And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of bloodWhich was not so before.—There’s no such thing.It is the bloody business which informsThus to mine eyes.—Now o’er the one half-worldNature seems dead and wicked dreams abuseThe curtain’d sleep. Witchcraft celebratesPale Hecate’s off’rings; and wither’d murderAlarum’d by his sentinel the wolfWhose howl’s his watch thus with his stealthy paceWith Tarquin’s ravishing strides towards his designMoves like a ghost.—Thou sure and firm-set earthHear not my steps which way they walk for fearThy very stones prate of my whereaboutAnd take the present horror from the timeWhich now suits with it.—Whiles I threat he lives.Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. [_A bell rings._]I go and it is done. The bell invites me.Hear it not Duncan for it is a knellThat summons thee to heaven or to hell. [_Exit._]SCENE II. The same. Enter Lady Macbeth.LADY MACBETH.That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold:What hath quench’d them hath given me fire.—Hark!—Peace!It was the owl that shriek’d the fatal bellmanWhich gives the stern’st good night. He is about it.The doors are open; and the surfeited groomsDo mock their charge with snores: I have drugg’d their possetsThat death and nature do contend about themWhether they live or die.MACBETH.[_Within._] Who’s there?—what ho!LADY MACBETH.Alack! I am afraid they have awak’dAnd ’tis not done. Th’ attempt and not the deedConfounds us.—Hark!—I laid their daggers ready;He could not miss ’em.—Had he not resembledMy father as he slept I had done’t.—My husband! Enter Macbeth.MACBETH.I have done the deed.—Didst thou not hear a noise?LADY MACBETH.I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.Did not you speak?MACBETH.When?LADY MACBETH.Now.MACBETH.As I descended?LADY MACBETH.Ay.MACBETH.Hark!—Who lies i’ th’ second chamber?LADY MACBETH.Donalbain.MACBETH.This is a sorry sight. [_Looking on his hands._]LADY MACBETH.A foolish thought to say a sorry sight.MACBETH.There’s one did laugh in’s sleep and one cried “Murder!”That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them.But they did say their prayers and address’d themAgain to sleep.LADY MACBETH.There are two lodg’d together.MACBETH.One cried “God bless us!” and “Amen” the otherAs they had seen me with these hangman’s hands.List’ning their fear I could not say “Amen”When they did say “God bless us.”LADY MACBETH.Consider it not so deeply.MACBETH.But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”?I had most need of blessing and “Amen”Stuck in my throat.LADY MACBETH.These deeds must not be thoughtAfter these ways; so it will make us mad.MACBETH.Methought I heard a voice cry “Sleep no more!Macbeth does murder sleep”—the innocent sleep;Sleep that knits up the ravell’d sleave of careThe death of each day’s life sore labour’s bathBalm of hurt minds great nature’s second courseChief nourisher in life’s feast.LADY MACBETH.What do you mean?MACBETH.Still it cried “Sleep no more!” to all the house:“Glamis hath murder’d sleep and therefore CawdorShall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more!”LADY MACBETH.Who was it that thus cried? Why worthy thaneYou do unbend your noble strength to thinkSo brainsickly of things. Go get some waterAnd wash this filthy witness from your hand.—Why did you bring these daggers from the place?They must lie there: go carry them and smearThe sleepy grooms with blood.MACBETH.I’ll go no more:I am afraid to think what I have done;Look on’t again I dare not.LADY MACBETH.Infirm of purpose!Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the deadAre but as pictures. ’Tis the eye of childhoodThat fears a painted devil. If he do bleedI’ll gild the faces of the grooms withalFor it must seem their guilt. [_Exit. Knocking within._]MACBETH.Whence is that knocking?How is’t with me when every noise appals me?What hands are here? Ha they pluck out mine eyes!Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this bloodClean from my hand? No this my hand will ratherThe multitudinous seas incarnadineMaking the green one red. Enter Lady Macbeth.LADY MACBETH.My hands are of your color but I shameTo wear a heart so white. [_Knocking within._] I hear knockingAt the south entry:—retire we to our chamber.A little water clears us of this deed:How easy is it then! Your constancyHath left you unattended.—[_Knocking within._] Hark more knocking.Get on your nightgown lest occasion call usAnd show us to be watchers. Be not lostSo poorly in your thoughts.MACBETH.To know my deed ’twere best not know myself. [_Knocking within._]Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst! [_Exeunt._]SCENE III. The same. Enter a Porter. Knocking within.PORTER.Here’s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate he shouldhave old turning the key. [_Knocking._] Knock knock knock. Who’sthere i’ th’ name of Belzebub? Here’s a farmer that hanged himself onthe expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about you;here you’ll sweat for’t. [_Knocking._] Knock knock! Who’s there i’th’ other devil’s name? Faith here’s an equivocator that could swearin both the scales against either scale who committed treason enoughfor God’s sake yet could not equivocate to heaven: O come inequivocator. [_Knocking._] Knock knock knock! Who’s there? Faithhere’s an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a Frenchhose: come in tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._]Knock knock. Never at quiet! What are you?—But this place is too coldfor hell. I’ll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let insome of all professions that go the primrose way to th’ everlastingbonfire. [_Knocking._] Anon anon! I pray you remember the porter. [_Opens the gate._] Enter Macduff and Lennox.MACDUFF.Was it so late friend ere you went to bedThat you do lie so late?PORTER.Faith sir we were carousing till the second cock; and drink sir isa great provoker of three things.MACDUFF.What three things does drink especially provoke?PORTER.Marry sir nose-painting sleep and urine. Lechery sir it provokesand unprovokes; it provokes the desire but it takes away theperformance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator withlechery: it makes him and it mars him; it sets him on and it takeshim off; it persuades him and disheartens him; makes him stand to andnot stand to; in conclusion equivocates him in a sleep and giving himthe lie leaves him.MACDUFF.I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.PORTER.That it did sir i’ the very throat on me; but I requited him for hislie; and (I think) being too strong for him though he took up my legssometime yet I made a shift to cast him.MACDUFF.Is thy master stirring? Enter Macbeth.Our knocking has awak’d him; here he comes.LENNOX.Good morrow noble sir!MACBETH.Good morrow both!MACDUFF.Is the King stirring worthy thane?MACBETH.Not yet.MACDUFF.He did command me to call timely on him.I have almost slipp’d the hour.MACBETH.I’ll bring you to him.MACDUFF.I know this is a joyful trouble to you;But yet ’tis one.MACBETH.The labour we delight in physics pain.This is the door.MACDUFF.I’ll make so bold to call.For ’tis my limited service. [_Exit Macduff._]LENNOX.Goes the King hence today?MACBETH.He does. He did appoint so.LENNOX.The night has been unruly: where we layOur chimneys were blown down and as they sayLamentings heard i’ th’ air strange screams of deathAnd prophesying with accents terribleOf dire combustion and confus’d eventsNew hatch’d to the woeful time. The obscure birdClamour’d the live-long night. Some say the earthWas feverous and did shake.MACBETH.’Twas a rough night.LENNOX.My young remembrance cannot parallelA fellow to it. Enter Macduff.MACDUFF.O horror horror horror!Tongue nor heart cannot conceive nor name thee!MACBETH LENNOX.What’s the matter?MACDUFF.Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!Most sacrilegious murder hath broke opeThe Lord’s anointed temple and stole thenceThe life o’ th’ building.MACBETH.What is’t you say? the life?LENNOX.Mean you his majesty?MACDUFF.Approach the chamber and destroy your sightWith a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak.See and then speak yourselves. [_Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox._]Awake awake!—Ring the alarum bell.—Murder and treason!Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!Shake off this downy sleep death’s counterfeitAnd look on death itself! Up up and seeThe great doom’s image. Malcolm! Banquo!As from your graves rise up and walk like spritesTo countenance this horror! [_Alarum-bell rings._] Enter Lady Macbeth.LADY MACBETH.What’s the businessThat such a hideous trumpet calls to parleyThe sleepers of the house? Speak speak!MACDUFF.O gentle lady’Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:The repetition in a woman’s earWould murder as it fell. Enter Banquo.O Banquo Banquo!Our royal master’s murder’d!LADY MACBETH.Woe alas!What in our house?BANQUO.Too cruel anywhere.—Dear Duff I pr’ythee contradict thyselfAnd say it is not so. Enter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross.MACBETH.Had I but died an hour before this chanceI had liv’d a blessed time; for from this instantThere’s nothing serious in mortality.All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;The wine of life is drawn and the mere leesIs left this vault to brag of. Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.DONALBAIN.What is amiss?MACBETH.You are and do not know’t:The spring the head the fountain of your bloodIs stopp’d; the very source of it is stopp’d.MACDUFF.Your royal father’s murder’d.MALCOLM.O by whom?LENNOX.Those of his chamber as it seem’d had done’t:Their hands and faces were all badg’d with blood;So were their daggers which unwip’d we foundUpon their pillows. They star’d and were distracted;No man’s life was to be trusted with them.MACBETH.O yet I do repent me of my furyThat I did kill them.MACDUFF.Wherefore did you so?MACBETH.Who can be wise amaz’d temperate and furiousLoyal and neutral in a moment? No man:Th’ expedition of my violent loveOutrun the pauser reason. Here lay DuncanHis silver skin lac’d with his golden blood;And his gash’d stabs look’d like a breach in natureFor ruin’s wasteful entrance: there the murderersSteep’d in the colours of their trade their daggersUnmannerly breech’d with gore. Who could refrainThat had a heart to love and in that heartCourage to make’s love known?LADY MACBETH.Help me hence ho!MACDUFF.Look to the lady.MALCOLM.Why do we hold our tonguesThat most may claim this argument for ours?DONALBAIN.What should be spoken here where our fateHid in an auger hole may rush and seize us?Let’s away. Our tears are not yet brew’d.MALCOLM.Nor our strong sorrowUpon the foot of motion.BANQUO.Look to the lady:— [_Lady Macbeth is carried out._]And when we have our naked frailties hidThat suffer in exposure let us meetAnd question this most bloody piece of workTo know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:In the great hand of God I stand; and thenceAgainst the undivulg’d pretence I fightOf treasonous malice.MACDUFF.And so do I.ALL.So all.MACBETH.Let’s briefly put on manly readinessAnd meet i’ th’ hall together.ALL.Well contented. [_Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain._]MALCOLM.What will you do? Let’s not consort with them:To show an unfelt sorrow is an officeWhich the false man does easy. I’ll to England.DONALBAIN.To Ireland I. Our separated fortuneShall keep us both the safer. Where we areThere’s daggers in men’s smiles: the near in bloodThe nearer bloody.MALCOLM.This murderous shaft that’s shotHath not yet lighted; and our safest wayIs to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;And let us not be dainty of leave-takingBut shift away. There’s warrant in that theftWhich steals itself when there’s no mercy left. [_Exeunt._]SCENE IV. The same. Without the Castle. Enter Ross and an Old Man.OLD MAN.Threescore and ten I can remember wellWithin the volume of which time I have seenHours dreadful and things strange but this sore nightHath trifled former knowings.ROSS.Ha good fatherThou seest the heavens as troubled with man’s actThreatens his bloody stage: by the clock ’tis dayAnd yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp.Is’t night’s predominance or the day’s shameThat darkness does the face of earth entombWhen living light should kiss it?OLD MAN.’Tis unnaturalEven like the deed that’s done. On Tuesday lastA falcon towering in her pride of placeWas by a mousing owl hawk’d at and kill’d.ROSS.And Duncan’s horses (a thing most strange and certain)Beauteous and swift the minions of their raceTurn’d wild in nature broke their stalls flung outContending ’gainst obedience as they would makeWar with mankind.OLD MAN.’Tis said they eat each other.ROSS.They did so; to the amazement of mine eyesThat look’d upon’t.Here comes the good Macduff. Enter Macduff.How goes the world sir now?MACDUFF.Why see you not?ROSS.Is’t known who did this more than bloody deed?MACDUFF.Those that Macbeth hath slain.ROSS.Alas the day!What good could they pretend?MACDUFF.They were suborn’d.Malcolm and Donalbain the King’s two sonsAre stol’n away and fled; which puts upon themSuspicion of the deed.ROSS.’Gainst nature still:Thriftless ambition that will ravin upThine own life’s means!—Then ’tis most likeThe sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.MACDUFF.He is already nam’d; and gone to SconeTo be invested.ROSS.Where is Duncan’s body?MACDUFF.Carried to ColmekillThe sacred storehouse of his predecessorsAnd guardian of their bones.ROSS.Will you to Scone?MACDUFF.No cousin I’ll to Fife.ROSS.Well I will thither.MACDUFF.Well may you see things well done there. Adieu!Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!ROSS.Farewell father.OLD MAN.God’s benison go with you; and with thoseThat would make good of bad and friends of foes! [_Exeunt._]ACT IIISCENE I. Forres. A Room in the Palace. Enter Banquo.BANQUO.Thou hast it now King Cawdor Glamis allAs the Weird Women promis’d; and I fearThou play’dst most foully for’t; yet it was saidIt should not stand in thy posterity;But that myself should be the root and fatherOf many kings. If there come truth from them(As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine)Why by the verities on thee made goodMay they not be my oracles as wellAnd set me up in hope? But hush; no more. Sennet sounded. Enter Macbeth as King Lady Macbeth as Queen; Lennox Ross Lords and Attendants.MACBETH.Here’s our chief guest.LADY MACBETH.If he had been forgottenIt had been as a gap in our great feastAnd all-thing unbecoming.MACBETH.Tonight we hold a solemn supper sirAnd I’ll request your presence.BANQUO.Let your HighnessCommand upon me to the which my dutiesAre with a most indissoluble tieFor ever knit.MACBETH.Ride you this afternoon?BANQUO.Ay my good lord.MACBETH.We should have else desir’d your good advice(Which still hath been both grave and prosperous)In this day’s council; but we’ll take tomorrow.Is’t far you ride?BANQUO.As far my lord as will fill up the time’Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the betterI must become a borrower of the nightFor a dark hour or twain.MACBETH.Fail not our feast.BANQUO.My lord I will not.MACBETH.We hear our bloody cousins are bestow’dIn England and in Ireland; not confessingTheir cruel parricide filling their hearersWith strange invention. But of that tomorrowWhen therewithal we shall have cause of stateCraving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieuTill you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?BANQUO.Ay my good lord: our time does call upon’s.MACBETH.I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;And so I do commend you to their backs.Farewell.— [_Exit Banquo._]Let every man be master of his timeTill seven at night; to make societyThe sweeter welcome we will keep ourselfTill supper time alone: while then God be with you. [_Exeunt Lady Macbeth Lords &c._]Sirrah a word with you. Attend those menOur pleasure?SERVANT.They are my lord without the palace gate.MACBETH.Bring them before us. [_Exit Servant._]To be thus is nothingBut to be safely thus. Our fears in BanquoStick deep and in his royalty of natureReigns that which would be fear’d: ’tis much he dares;And to that dauntless temper of his mindHe hath a wisdom that doth guide his valourTo act in safety. There is none but heWhose being I do fear: and under himMy genius is rebuk’d; as it is saidMark Antony’s was by Caesar. He chid the sistersWhen first they put the name of king upon meAnd bade them speak to him; then prophet-likeThey hail’d him father to a line of kings:Upon my head they plac’d a fruitless crownAnd put a barren sceptre in my gripeThence to be wrench’d with an unlineal handNo son of mine succeeding. If’t be soFor Banquo’s issue have I fil’d my mind;For them the gracious Duncan have I murder’d;Put rancours in the vessel of my peaceOnly for them; and mine eternal jewelGiven to the common enemy of manTo make them kings the seed of Banquo kings!Rather than so come fate into the listAnd champion me to th’ utterance!—Who’s there?— Enter Servant with two Murderers.Now go to the door and stay there till we call. [_Exit Servant._]Was it not yesterday we spoke together?FIRST MURDERER.It was so please your Highness.MACBETH.Well then nowHave you consider’d of my speeches? KnowThat it was he in the times past which held youSo under fortune which you thought had beenOur innocent self? This I made good to youIn our last conference pass’d in probation with youHow you were borne in hand how cross’d the instrumentsWho wrought with them and all things else that mightTo half a soul and to a notion craz’dSay “Thus did Banquo.”FIRST MURDERER.You made it known to us.MACBETH.I did so; and went further which is nowOur point of second meeting. Do you findYour patience so predominant in your natureThat you can let this go? Are you so gospell’dTo pray for this good man and for his issueWhose heavy hand hath bow’d you to the graveAnd beggar’d yours forever?FIRST MURDERER.We are men my liege.MACBETH.Ay in the catalogue ye go for men;As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels cursShoughs water-rugs and demi-wolves are cleptAll by the name of dogs: the valu’d fileDistinguishes the swift the slow the subtleThe housekeeper the hunter every oneAccording to the gift which bounteous natureHath in him clos’d; whereby he does receiveParticular addition from the billThat writes them all alike: and so of men.Now if you have a station in the fileNot i’ th’ worst rank of manhood say’t;And I will put that business in your bosomsWhose execution takes your enemy offGrapples you to the heart and love of usWho wear our health but sickly in his lifeWhich in his death were perfect.SECOND MURDERER.I am one my liegeWhom the vile blows and buffets of the worldHath so incens’d that I am reckless whatI do to spite the world.FIRST MURDERER.And I anotherSo weary with disasters tugg’d with fortuneThat I would set my life on any chanceTo mend it or be rid on’t.MACBETH.Both of youKnow Banquo was your enemy.BOTH MURDERERS.True my lord.MACBETH.So is he mine; and in such bloody distanceThat every minute of his being thrustsAgainst my near’st of life; and though I couldWith barefac’d power sweep him from my sightAnd bid my will avouch it yet I must notFor certain friends that are both his and mineWhose loves I may not drop but wail his fallWho I myself struck down: and thence it isThat I to your assistance do make loveMasking the business from the common eyeFor sundry weighty reasons.SECOND MURDERER.We shall my lordPerform what you command us.FIRST MURDERER.Though our lives—MACBETH.Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at mostI will advise you where to plant yourselvesAcquaint you with the perfect spy o’ th’ timeThe moment on’t; for’t must be done tonightAnd something from the palace; always thoughtThat I require a clearness. And with him(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)Fleance his son that keeps him companyWhose absence is no less material to meThan is his father’s must embrace the fateOf that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.I’ll come to you anon.BOTH MURDERERS.We are resolv’d my lord.MACBETH.I’ll call upon you straight: abide within. [_Exeunt Murderers._]It is concluded. Banquo thy soul’s flightIf it find heaven must find it out tonight. [_Exit._]SCENE II. The same. Another Room in the Palace. Enter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.LADY MACBETH.Is Banquo gone from court?SERVANT.Ay madam but returns again tonight.LADY MACBETH.Say to the King I would attend his leisureFor a few words.SERVANT.Madam I will. [_Exit._]LADY MACBETH.Naught’s had all’s spentWhere our desire is got without content:’Tis safer to be that which we destroyThan by destruction dwell in doubtful joy. Enter Macbeth.How now my lord why do you keep aloneOf sorriest fancies your companions makingUsing those thoughts which should indeed have diedWith them they think on? Things without all remedyShould be without regard: what’s done is done.MACBETH.We have scorch’d the snake not kill’d it.She’ll close and be herself; whilst our poor maliceRemains in danger of her former tooth.But let the frame of things disjointBoth the worlds sufferEre we will eat our meal in fear and sleepIn the affliction of these terrible dreamsThat shake us nightly. Better be with the deadWhom we to gain our peace have sent to peaceThan on the torture of the mind to lieIn restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;After life’s fitful fever he sleeps well;Treason has done his worst: nor steel nor poisonMalice domestic foreign levy nothingCan touch him further.LADY MACBETH.Come onGently my lord sleek o’er your rugged looks;Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.MACBETH.So shall I love; and so I pray be you.Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;Present him eminence both with eye and tongue:Unsafe the while that weMust lave our honours in these flattering streamsAnd make our faces vizards to our heartsDisguising what they are.LADY MACBETH.You must leave this.MACBETH.O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife!Thou know’st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.LADY MACBETH.But in them nature’s copy’s not eterne.MACBETH.There’s comfort yet; they are assailable.Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flownHis cloister’d flight ere to black Hecate’s summonsThe shard-born beetle with his drowsy humsHath rung night’s yawning peal there shall be doneA deed of dreadful note.LADY MACBETH.What’s to be done?MACBETH.Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuckTill thou applaud the deed. Come seeling nightScarf up the tender eye of pitiful dayAnd with thy bloody and invisible handCancel and tear to pieces that great bondWhich keeps me pale!—Light thickens; and the crowMakes wing to th’ rooky wood.Good things of day begin to droop and drowseWhiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.Thou marvell’st at my words: but hold thee still;Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.So pr’ythee go with me. [_Exeunt._]SCENE III. The same. A Park or Lawn with a gate leading to the Palace. Enter three Murderers.FIRST MURDERER.But who did bid thee join with us?THIRD MURDERER.Macbeth.SECOND MURDERER.He needs not our mistrust; since he deliversOur offices and what we have to doTo the direction just.FIRST MURDERER.Then stand with us.The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day.Now spurs the lated traveller apaceTo gain the timely inn; and near approachesThe subject of our watch.THIRD MURDERER.Hark! I hear horses.BANQUO.[_Within._] Give us a light there ho!SECOND MURDERER.Then ’tis he; the restThat are within the note of expectationAlready are i’ th’ court.FIRST MURDERER.His horses go about.THIRD MURDERER.Almost a mile; but he does usuallySo all men do from hence to the palace gateMake it their walk. Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch.SECOND MURDERER.A light a light!THIRD MURDERER.’Tis he.FIRST MURDERER.Stand to’t.BANQUO.It will be rain tonight.FIRST MURDERER.Let it come down. [_Assaults Banquo._]BANQUO.O treachery! Fly good Fleance fly fly fly!Thou mayst revenge—O slave! [_Dies. Fleance escapes._]THIRD MURDERER.Who did strike out the light?FIRST MURDERER.Was’t not the way?THIRD MURDERER.There’s but one down: the son is fled.SECOND MURDERER.We have lost best half of our affair.FIRST MURDERER.Well let’s away and say how much is done. [_Exeunt._]SCENE IV. The same. A Room of state in the Palace. A banquet prepared. Enter Macbeth Lady Macbeth Ross Lennox Lords and Attendants.MACBETH.You know your own degrees sit down. At firstAnd last the hearty welcome.LORDS.Thanks to your Majesty.MACBETH.Ourself will mingle with societyAnd play the humble host.Our hostess keeps her state; but in best timeWe will require her welcome.LADY MACBETH.Pronounce it for me sir to all our friends;For my heart speaks they are welcome. Enter first Murderer to the door.MACBETH.See they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks.Both sides are even: here I’ll sit i’ th’ midst.Be large in mirth; anon we’ll drink a measureThe table round. There’s blood upon thy face.MURDERER.’Tis Banquo’s then.MACBETH.’Tis better thee without than he within.Is he dispatch’d?MURDERER.My lord his throat is cut. That I did for him.MACBETH.Thou art the best o’ th’ cut-throats;Yet he’s good that did the like for Fleance:If thou didst it thou art the nonpareil.MURDERER.Most royal sirFleance is ’scap’d.MACBETH.Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect;Whole as the marble founded as the rockAs broad and general as the casing air:But now I am cabin’d cribb’d confin’d bound inTo saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo’s safe?MURDERER.Ay my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bidesWith twenty trenched gashes on his head;The least a death to nature.MACBETH.Thanks for that.There the grown serpent lies; the worm that’s fledHath nature that in time will venom breedNo teeth for th’ present.—Get thee gone; tomorrowWe’ll hear ourselves again. [_Exit Murderer._]LADY MACBETH.My royal lordYou do not give the cheer: the feast is soldThat is not often vouch’d while ’tis a-making’Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;Meeting were bare without it. The Ghost of Banquo rises and sits in Macbeth’s place.MACBETH.Sweet remembrancer!—Now good digestion wait on appetiteAnd health on both!LENNOX.May’t please your Highness sit.MACBETH.Here had we now our country’s honour roof’dWere the grac’d person of our Banquo present;Who may I rather challenge for unkindnessThan pity for mischance!ROSS.His absence sirLays blame upon his promise. Please’t your HighnessTo grace us with your royal company?MACBETH.The table’s full.LENNOX.Here is a place reserv’d sir.MACBETH.Where?LENNOX.Here my good lord. What is’t that moves your Highness?MACBETH.Which of you have done this?LORDS.What my good lord?MACBETH.Thou canst not say I did it. Never shakeThy gory locks at me.ROSS.Gentlemen rise; his Highness is not well.LADY MACBETH.Sit worthy friends. My lord is often thusAnd hath been from his youth: pray you keep seat;The fit is momentary; upon a thoughtHe will again be well. If much you note himYou shall offend him and extend his passion.Feed and regard him not.—Are you a man?MACBETH.Ay and a bold one that dare look on thatWhich might appal the devil.LADY MACBETH.O proper stuff!This is the very painting of your fear:This is the air-drawn dagger which you saidLed you to Duncan. O these flaws and starts(Impostors to true fear) would well becomeA woman’s story at a winter’s fireAuthoris’d by her grandam. Shame itself!Why do you make such faces? When all’s doneYou look but on a stool.MACBETH.Pr’ythee see there!Behold! look! lo! how say you?Why what care I? If thou canst nod speak too.—If charnel houses and our graves must sendThose that we bury back our monumentsShall be the maws of kites. [_Ghost disappears._]LADY MACBETH.What quite unmann’d in folly?MACBETH.If I stand here I saw him.LADY MACBETH.Fie for shame!MACBETH.Blood hath been shed ere now i’ th’ olden timeEre humane statute purg’d the gentle weal;Ay and since too murders have been perform’dToo terrible for the ear: the time has beenThat when the brains were out the man would dieAnd there an end; but now they rise againWith twenty mortal murders on their crownsAnd push us from our stools. This is more strangeThan such a murder is.LADY MACBETH.My worthy lordYour noble friends do lack you.MACBETH.I do forget.—Do not muse at me my most worthy friends.I have a strange infirmity which is nothingTo those that know me. Come love and health to all;Then I’ll sit down.—Give me some wine fill full.—I drink to the general joy o’ th’ whole tableAnd to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss:Would he were here. Ghost rises again.To all and him we thirstAnd all to all.LORDS.Our duties and the pledge.MACBETH.Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!Thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold;Thou hast no speculation in those eyesWhich thou dost glare with!LADY MACBETH.Think of this good peersBut as a thing of custom: ’tis no otherOnly it spoils the pleasure of the time.MACBETH.What man dare I dare:Approach thou like the rugged Russian bearThe arm’d rhinoceros or th’ Hyrcan tiger;Take any shape but that and my firm nervesShall never tremble: or be alive againAnd dare me to the desert with thy sword;If trembling I inhabit then protest meThe baby of a girl. Hence horrible shadow!Unreal mock’ry hence! [_Ghost disappears._]Why so;—being goneI am a man again.—Pray you sit still.LADY MACBETH.You have displaced the mirth broke the good meetingWith most admir’d disorder.MACBETH.Can such things beAnd overcome us like a summer’s cloudWithout our special wonder? You make me strangeEven to the disposition that I oweWhen now I think you can behold such sightsAnd keep the natural ruby of your cheeksWhen mine are blanch’d with fear.ROSS.What sights my lord?LADY MACBETH.I pray you speak not; he grows worse and worse;Question enrages him. At once good night:—Stand not upon the order of your goingBut go at once.LENNOX.Good night; and better healthAttend his Majesty!LADY MACBETH.A kind good night to all! [_Exeunt all Lords and Atendants._]MACBETH.It will have blood they say blood will have blood.Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;Augurs and understood relations haveBy magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forthThe secret’st man of blood.—What is the night?LADY MACBETH.Almost at odds with morning which is which.MACBETH.How say’st thou that Macduff denies his personAt our great bidding?LADY MACBETH.Did you send to him sir?MACBETH.I hear it by the way; but I will send.There’s not a one of them but in his houseI keep a servant fee’d. I will tomorrow(And betimes I will) to the Weird Sisters:More shall they speak; for now I am bent to knowBy the worst means the worst. For mine own goodAll causes shall give way: I am in bloodStepp’d in so far that should I wade no moreReturning were as tedious as go o’er.Strange things I have in head that will to handWhich must be acted ere they may be scann’d.LADY MACBETH.You lack the season of all natures sleep.MACBETH.Come we’ll to sleep.

Enter the three Witches meeting Hecate.FIRST WITCH.Why how now Hecate? you look angerly.HECATE.Have I not reason beldams as you areSaucy and overbold? How did you dareTo trade and traffic with MacbethIn riddles and affairs of death;And I the mistress of your charmsThe close contriver of all harmsWas never call’d to bear my partOr show the glory of our art?And which is worse all you have doneHath been but for a wayward sonSpiteful and wrathful; who as others doLoves for his own ends not for you.But make amends now: get you goneAnd at the pit of AcheronMeet me i’ th’ morning: thither heWill come to know his destiny.Your vessels and your spells provideYour charms and everything beside.I am for th’ air; this night I’ll spendUnto a dismal and a fatal end.Great business must be wrought ere noon.Upon the corner of the moonThere hangs a vap’rous drop profound;I’ll catch it ere it come to ground:And that distill’d by magic sleightsShall raise such artificial spritesAs by the strength of their illusionShall draw him on to his confusion.He shall spurn fate scorn death and bearHis hopes ’bove wisdom grace and fear.And you all know securityIs mortals’ chiefest enemy. [_Music and song within “Come away come away” &c._]Hark! I am call’d; my little spirit seeSits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.

Enter Lennox and another Lord.LENNOX.My former speeches have but hit your thoughtsWhich can interpret farther: only I sayThing’s have been strangely borne. The gracious DuncanWas pitied of Macbeth:—marry he was dead:—And the right valiant Banquo walk’d too late;Whom you may say if’t please you Fleance kill’dFor Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.Who cannot want the thought how monstrousIt was for Malcolm and for DonalbainTo kill their gracious father? damned fact!How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straightIn pious rage the two delinquents tearThat were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?Was not that nobly done? Ay and wisely too;For ’twould have anger’d any heart aliveTo hear the men deny’t. So that I sayHe has borne all things well: and I do thinkThat had he Duncan’s sons under his key(As and’t please heaven he shall not) they should findWhat ’twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.But peace!—for from broad words and ’cause he fail’dHis presence at the tyrant’s feast I hearMacduff lives in disgrace. Sir can you tellWhere he bestows himself?LORD.The son of DuncanFrom whom this tyrant holds the due of birthLives in the English court and is receiv’dOf the most pious Edward with such graceThat the malevolence of fortune nothingTakes from his high respect. Thither MacduffIs gone to pray the holy king upon his aidTo wake Northumberland and warlike SiwardThat by the help of these (with Him aboveTo ratify the work) we may againGive to our tables meat sleep to our nights;Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knivesDo faithful homage and receive free honoursAll which we pine for now. And this reportHath so exasperate the King that hePrepares for some attempt of war.LENNOX.Sent he to Macduff?LORD.He did: and with an absolute “Sir not I”The cloudy messenger turns me his backAnd hums as who should say “You’ll rue the timeThat clogs me with this answer.”LENNOX.And that well mightAdvise him to a caution t’ hold what distanceHis wisdom can provide. Some holy angelFly to the court of England and unfoldHis message ere he come that a swift blessingMay soon return to this our suffering countryUnder a hand accurs’d!LORD.I’ll send my prayers with him.

Enter Lady Macduff her Son and Ross.LADY MACDUFF.What had he done to make him fly the land?ROSS.You must have patience madam.LADY MACDUFF.He had none:His flight was madness: when our actions do notOur fears do make us traitors.ROSS.You know notWhether it was his wisdom or his fear.LADY MACDUFF.Wisdom! to leave his wife to leave his babesHis mansion and his titles in a placeFrom whence himself does fly? He loves us not:He wants the natural touch; for the poor wrenThe most diminutive of birds will fightHer young ones in her nest against the owl.All is the fear and nothing is the love;As little is the wisdom where the flightSo runs against all reason.ROSS.My dearest cozI pray you school yourself: but for your husbandHe is noble wise judicious and best knowsThe fits o’ th’ season. I dare not speak much further:But cruel are the times when we are traitorsAnd do not know ourselves; when we hold rumourFrom what we fear yet know not what we fearBut float upon a wild and violent seaEach way and move—I take my leave of you:Shall not be long but I’ll be here again.Things at the worst will cease or else climb upwardTo what they were before.—My pretty cousinBlessing upon you!LADY MACDUFF.Father’d he is and yet he’s fatherless.ROSS.I am so much a fool should I stay longerIt would be my disgrace and your discomfort:I take my leave at once. [_Exit._]LADY MACDUFF.Sirrah your father’s dead.And what will you do now? How will you live?SON.As birds do mother.LADY MACDUFF.What with worms and flies?SON.With what I get I mean; and so do they.LADY MACDUFF.Poor bird! thou’dst never fear the net nor limeThe pit-fall nor the gin.SON.Why should I mother? Poor birds they are not set for.My father is not dead for all your saying.LADY MACDUFF.Yes he is dead: how wilt thou do for a father?SON.Nay how will you do for a husband?LADY MACDUFF.Why I can buy me twenty at any market.SON.Then you’ll buy ’em to sell again.LADY MACDUFF.Thou speak’st with all thy wit;And yet i’ faith with wit enough for thee.SON.Was my father a traitor mother?LADY MACDUFF.Ay that he was.SON.What is a traitor?LADY MACDUFF.Why one that swears and lies.SON.And be all traitors that do so?LADY MACDUFF.Every one that does so is a traitor and must be hanged.SON.And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?LADY MACDUFF.Every one.SON.Who must hang them?LADY MACDUFF.Why the honest men.SON.Then the liars and swearers are fools: for there are liars and swearersenow to beat the honest men and hang up them.LADY MACDUFF.Now God help thee poor monkey! But how wilt thou do for a father?SON.If he were dead you’ld weep for him: if you would not it were a goodsign that I should quickly have a new father.LADY MACDUFF.Poor prattler how thou talk’st! Enter a Messenger.MESSENGER.Bless you fair dame! I am not to you knownThough in your state of honour I am perfect.I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:If you will take a homely man’s adviceBe not found here; hence with your little ones.To fright you thus methinks I am too savage;To do worse to you were fell crueltyWhich is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!I dare abide no longer. [_Exit._]LADY MACDUFF.Whither should I fly?I have done no harm. But I remember nowI am in this earthly world where to do harmIs often laudable; to do good sometimeAccounted dangerous folly:  why then alasDo I put up that womanly defenceTo say I have done no harm? What are these faces? Enter Murderers.FIRST MURDERER.Where is your husband?LADY MACDUFF.I hope in no place so unsanctifiedWhere such as thou mayst find him.FIRST MURDERER.He’s a traitor.SON.Thou liest thou shag-ear’d villain!FIRST MURDERER.What you egg! [_Stabbing him._]Young fry of treachery!SON.He has kill’d me mother:Run away I pray you! [_Dies. Exit Lady Macduff crying “Murder!” and pursued by the Murderers._]SCENE III. England. Before the King’s Palace. Enter Malcolm and Macduff.MALCOLM.Let us seek out some desolate shade and thereWeep our sad bosoms empty.MACDUFF.Let us ratherHold fast the mortal sword and like good menBestride our down-fall’n birthdom. Each new mornNew widows howl new orphans cry; new sorrowsStrike heaven on the face that it resoundsAs if it felt with Scotland and yell’d outLike syllable of dolour.MALCOLM.What I believe I’ll wail;What know believe; and what I can redressAs I shall find the time to friend I will.What you have spoke it may be so perchance.This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tonguesWas once thought honest: you have loved him well;He hath not touch’d you yet. I am young; but somethingYou may deserve of him through me; and wisdomTo offer up a weak poor innocent lambTo appease an angry god.MACDUFF.I am not treacherous.MALCOLM.But Macbeth is.A good and virtuous nature may recoilIn an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose.Angels are bright still though the brightest fell:Though all things foul would wear the brows of graceYet grace must still look so.MACDUFF.I have lost my hopes.MALCOLM.Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.Why in that rawness left you wife and childThose precious motives those strong knots of loveWithout leave-taking?—I pray youLet not my jealousies be your dishonoursBut mine own safeties. You may be rightly justWhatever I shall think.MACDUFF.Bleed bleed poor country!Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sureFor goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;The title is affeer’d.—Fare thee well lord:I would not be the villain that thou think’stFor the whole space that’s in the tyrant’s graspAnd the rich East to boot.MALCOLM.Be not offended:I speak not as in absolute fear of you.I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;It weeps it bleeds; and each new day a gashIs added to her wounds. I think withalThere would be hands uplifted in my right;And here from gracious England have I offerOf goodly thousands: but for all thisWhen I shall tread upon the tyrant’s headOr wear it on my sword yet my poor countryShall have more vices than it had beforeMore suffer and more sundry ways than everBy him that shall succeed.MACDUFF.What should he be?MALCOLM.It is myself I mean; in whom I knowAll the particulars of vice so graftedThat when they shall be open’d black MacbethWill seem as pure as snow; and the poor stateEsteem him as a lamb being compar’dWith my confineless harms.MACDUFF.Not in the legionsOf horrid hell can come a devil more damn’dIn evils to top Macbeth.MALCOLM.I grant him bloodyLuxurious avaricious false deceitfulSudden malicious smacking of every sinThat has a name: but there’s no bottom noneIn my voluptuousness: your wives your daughtersYour matrons and your maids could not fill upThe cistern of my lust; and my desireAll continent impediments would o’erbearThat did oppose my will: better MacbethThan such an one to reign.MACDUFF.Boundless intemperanceIn nature is a tyranny; it hath beenTh’ untimely emptying of the happy throneAnd fall of many kings. But fear not yetTo take upon you what is yours: you mayConvey your pleasures in a spacious plentyAnd yet seem cold—the time you may so hoodwink.We have willing dames enough; there cannot beThat vulture in you to devour so manyAs will to greatness dedicate themselvesFinding it so inclin’d.MALCOLM.With this there growsIn my most ill-compos’d affection suchA staunchless avarice that were I kingI should cut off the nobles for their lands;Desire his jewels and this other’s house:And my more-having would be as a sauceTo make me hunger more; that I should forgeQuarrels unjust against the good and loyalDestroying them for wealth.MACDUFF.This avariceSticks deeper; grows with more pernicious rootThan summer-seeming lust; and it hath beenThe sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;Scotland hath foisons to fill up your willOf your mere own. All these are portableWith other graces weigh’d.MALCOLM.But I have none: the king-becoming gracesAs justice verity temp’rance stablenessBounty perseverance mercy lowlinessDevotion patience courage fortitudeI have no relish of them; but aboundIn the division of each several crimeActing it many ways. Nay had I power I shouldPour the sweet milk of concord into hellUproar the universal peace confoundAll unity on earth.MACDUFF.O Scotland Scotland!MALCOLM.If such a one be fit to govern speak:I am as I have spoken.MACDUFF.Fit to govern?No not to live.—O nation miserableWith an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter’dWhen shalt thou see thy wholesome days againSince that the truest issue of thy throneBy his own interdiction stands accus’dAnd does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal fatherWas a most sainted king. The queen that bore theeOft’ner upon her knees than on her feetDied every day she lived. Fare thee well!These evils thou repeat’st upon thyselfHave banish’d me from Scotland.—O my breastThy hope ends here!MALCOLM.Macduff this noble passionChild of integrity hath from my soulWiped the black scruples reconcil’d my thoughtsTo thy good truth and honour. Devilish MacbethBy many of these trains hath sought to win meInto his power and modest wisdom plucks meFrom over-credulous haste: but God aboveDeal between thee and me! for even nowI put myself to thy direction andUnspeak mine own detraction; here abjureThe taints and blames I laid upon myselfFor strangers to my nature. I am yetUnknown to woman; never was forsworn;Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;At no time broke my faith; would not betrayThe devil to his fellow; and delightNo less in truth than life: my first false speakingWas this upon myself. What I am trulyIs thine and my poor country’s to command:Whither indeed before thy here-approachOld Siward with ten thousand warlike menAlready at a point was setting forth.Now we’ll together and the chance of goodnessBe like our warranted quarrel. Why are you silent?MACDUFF.Such welcome and unwelcome things at once’Tis hard to reconcile. Enter a Doctor.MALCOLM.Well; more anon.—Comes the King forth I pray you?DOCTOR.Ay sir. There are a crew of wretched soulsThat stay his cure: their malady convincesThe great assay of art; but at his touchSuch sanctity hath heaven given his handThey presently amend.MALCOLM.I thank you doctor. [_Exit Doctor._]MACDUFF.What’s the disease he means?MALCOLM.’Tis call’d the evil:A most miraculous work in this good king;Which often since my here-remain in EnglandI have seen him do. How he solicits heavenHimself best knows but strangely-visited peopleAll swoln and ulcerous pitiful to the eyeThe mere despair of surgery he cures;Hanging a golden stamp about their necksPut on with holy prayers: and ’tis spokenTo the succeeding royalty he leavesThe healing benediction. With this strange virtueHe hath a heavenly gift of prophecy;And sundry blessings hang about his throneThat speak him full of grace. Enter Ross.MACDUFF.See who comes here?MALCOLM.My countryman; but yet I know him not.MACDUFF.My ever-gentle cousin welcome hither.MALCOLM.I know him now. Good God betimes removeThe means that makes us strangers!ROSS.Sir amen.MACDUFF.Stands Scotland where it did?ROSS.Alas poor countryAlmost afraid to know itself! It cannotBe call’d our mother but our grave where nothingBut who knows nothing is once seen to smile;Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rent the airAre made not mark’d; where violent sorrow seemsA modern ecstasy. The dead man’s knellIs there scarce ask’d for who; and good men’s livesExpire before the flowers in their capsDying or ere they sicken.MACDUFF.O relationToo nice and yet too true!MALCOLM.What’s the newest grief?ROSS.That of an hour’s age doth hiss the speaker;Each minute teems a new one.MACDUFF.How does my wife?ROSS.Why well.MACDUFF.And all my children?ROSS.Well too.MACDUFF.The tyrant has not batter’d at their peace?ROSS.No; they were well at peace when I did leave ’em.MACDUFF.Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes’t?ROSS.When I came hither to transport the tidingsWhich I have heavily borne there ran a rumourOf many worthy fellows that were out;Which was to my belief witness’d the ratherFor that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot.Now is the time of help. Your eye in ScotlandWould create soldiers make our women fightTo doff their dire distresses.MALCOLM.Be’t their comfortWe are coming thither. Gracious England hathLent us good Siward and ten thousand men;An older and a better soldier noneThat Christendom gives out.ROSS.Would I could answerThis comfort with the like! But I have wordsThat would be howl’d out in the desert airWhere hearing should not latch them.MACDUFF.What concern they?The general cause? or is it a fee-griefDue to some single breast?ROSS.No mind that’s honestBut in it shares some woe though the main partPertains to you alone.MACDUFF.If it be mineKeep it not from me quickly let me have it.ROSS.Let not your ears despise my tongue for everWhich shall possess them with the heaviest soundThat ever yet they heard.MACDUFF.Humh! I guess at it.ROSS.Your castle is surpris’d; your wife and babesSavagely slaughter’d. To relate the mannerWere on the quarry of these murder’d deerTo add the death of you.MALCOLM.Merciful heaven!—What man! ne’er pull your hat upon your brows.Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speakWhispers the o’er-fraught heart and bids it break.MACDUFF.My children too?ROSS.Wife children servants allThat could be found.MACDUFF.And I must be from thence!My wife kill’d too?ROSS.I have said.MALCOLM.Be comforted:Let’s make us med’cines of our great revengeTo cure this deadly grief.MACDUFF.He has no children.—All my pretty ones?Did you say all?—O hell-kite!—All?What all my pretty chickens and their damAt one fell swoop?MALCOLM.Dispute it like a man.MACDUFF.I shall do so;But I must also feel it as a man:I cannot but remember such things wereThat were most precious to me.—Did heaven look onAnd would not take their part? Sinful MacduffThey were all struck for thee! Naught that I amNot for their own demerits but for mineFell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!MALCOLM.Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let griefConvert to anger; blunt not the heart enrage it.MACDUFF.O I could play the woman with mine eyesAnd braggart with my tongue!—But gentle heavensCut short all intermission; front to frontBring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;Within my sword’s length set him; if he ’scapeHeaven forgive him too!MALCOLM.This tune goes manly.Come go we to the King. Our power is ready;Our lack is nothing but our leave. MacbethIs ripe for shaking and the powers abovePut on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;The night is long that never finds the day. [_Exeunt._]ACT VSCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle. Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman.DOCTOR.I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in yourreport. When was it she last walked?GENTLEWOMAN.Since his Majesty went into the field I have seen her rise from herbed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take forth paperfold it write upon’t read it afterwards seal it and again return tobed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.DOCTOR.A great perturbation in nature to receive at once the benefit ofsleep and do the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitationbesides her walking and other actual performances what at any timehave you heard her say?GENTLEWOMAN.That sir which I will not report after her.DOCTOR.You may to me; and ’tis most meet you should.GENTLEWOMAN.Neither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech. Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper.Lo you here she comes! This is her very guise; and upon my life fastasleep. Observe her; stand close.DOCTOR.How came she by that light?GENTLEWOMAN.Why it stood by her: she has light by her continually; ’tis hercommand.DOCTOR.You see her eyes are open.GENTLEWOMAN.Ay but their sense are shut.DOCTOR.What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.GENTLEWOMAN.It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands. Ihave known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.LADY MACBETH.Yet here’s a spot.DOCTOR.Hark she speaks. I will set down what comes from her to satisfy myremembrance the more strongly.LADY MACBETH.Out damned spot! out I say! One; two. Why then ’tis time to do’t.Hell is murky! Fie my lord fie! a soldier and afeard? What need wefear who knows it when none can call our power to account? Yet whowould have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?DOCTOR.Do you mark that?LADY MACBETH.The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?—What will these handsne’er be clean? No more o’ that my lord no more o’ that: you mar allwith this starting.DOCTOR.Go to go to. You have known what you should not.GENTLEWOMAN.She has spoke what she should not I am sure of that: heaven knows whatshe has known.LADY MACBETH.Here’s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia willnot sweeten this little hand. Oh oh oh!DOCTOR.What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.GENTLEWOMAN.I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the wholebody.DOCTOR.Well well well.GENTLEWOMAN.Pray God it be sir.DOCTOR.This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which havewalked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds.LADY MACBETH.Wash your hands put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell youyet again Banquo’s buried; he cannot come out on’s grave.DOCTOR.Even so?LADY MACBETH.To bed to bed. There’s knocking at the gate. Come come come comegive me your hand. What’s done cannot be undone. To bed to bed tobed. [_Exit._]DOCTOR.Will she go now to bed?GENTLEWOMAN.Directly.DOCTOR.Foul whisp’rings are abroad. Unnatural deedsDo breed unnatural troubles: infected mindsTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.More needs she the divine than the physician.—God God forgive us all! Look after her;Remove from her the means of all annoyanceAnd still keep eyes upon her. So good night:My mind she has mated and amaz’d my sight.I think but dare not speak.GENTLEWOMAN.Good night good doctor. [_Exeunt._]SCENE II. The Country near Dunsinane.

I have a fileOf all the gentry: there is Siward’s sonAnd many unrough youths that even nowProtest their first of manhood.MENTEITH.What does the tyrant?CAITHNESS.Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.Some say he’s mad; others that lesser hate himDo call it valiant fury: but for certainHe cannot buckle his distemper’d causeWithin the belt of rule.ANGUS.Now does he feelHis secret murders sticking on his hands;Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;Those he commands move only in commandNothing in love: now does he feel his titleHang loose about him like a giant’s robeUpon a dwarfish thief.MENTEITH.Who then shall blameHis pester’d senses to recoil and startWhen all that is within him does condemnItself for being there?CAITHNESS.Well march we onTo give obedience where ’tis truly ow’d:Meet we the med’cine of the sickly weal;And with him pour we in our country’s purgeEach drop of us.LENNOX.Or so much as it needsTo dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.Make we our march towards Birnam. [_Exeunt marching._]SCENE III. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle. Enter Macbeth Doctor and Attendants.MACBETH.Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:Till Birnam wood remove to DunsinaneI cannot taint with fear. What’s the boy Malcolm?Was he not born of woman? The spirits that knowAll mortal consequences have pronounc’d me thus:“Fear not Macbeth; no man that’s born of womanShall e’er have power upon thee.”—Then fly false thanesAnd mingle with the English epicures:The mind I sway by and the heart I bearShall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear. Enter a Servant.The devil damn thee black thou cream-fac’d loon!Where gott’st thou that goose look?SERVANT.There is ten thousand—MACBETH.Geese villain?SERVANT.Soldiers sir.MACBETH.Go prick thy face and over-red thy fearThou lily-liver’d boy. What soldiers patch?Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thineAre counsellors to fear. What soldiers whey-face?SERVANT.The English force so please you.MACBETH.Take thy face hence. [_Exit Servant._]Seyton!—I am sick at heartWhen I behold—Seyton I say!—This pushWill cheer me ever or disseat me now.I have liv’d long enough: my way of lifeIs fall’n into the sere the yellow leaf;And that which should accompany old ageAs honour love obedience troops of friendsI must not look to have; but in their steadCurses not loud but deep mouth-honour breathWhich the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.Seyton!— Enter Seyton.SEYTON.What’s your gracious pleasure?MACBETH.What news more?SEYTON.All is confirm’d my lord which was reported.MACBETH.I’ll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack’d.Give me my armour.SEYTON.’Tis not needed yet.MACBETH.I’ll put it on.Send out more horses skirr the country round;Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.—How does your patient doctor?DOCTOR.Not so sick my lordAs she is troubled with thick-coming fanciesThat keep her from her rest.MACBETH.Cure her of that:Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas’dPluck from the memory a rooted sorrowRaze out the written troubles of the brainAnd with some sweet oblivious antidoteCleanse the stuff’d bosom of that perilous stuffWhich weighs upon the heart?DOCTOR.Therein the patientMust minister to himself.MACBETH.Throw physic to the dogs I’ll none of it.Come put mine armour on; give me my staff:Seyton send out.—Doctor the Thanes fly from me.—Come sir despatch.—If thou couldst doctor castThe water of my land find her diseaseAnd purge it to a sound and pristine healthI would applaud thee to the very echoThat should applaud again.—Pull’t off I say.—What rhubarb senna or what purgative drugWould scour these English hence? Hear’st thou of them?DOCTOR.Ay my good lord. Your royal preparationMakes us hear something.MACBETH.Bring it after me.—I will not be afraid of death and baneTill Birnam forest come to Dunsinane. [_Exeunt all except Doctor._]DOCTOR.Were I from Dunsinane away and clearProfit again should hardly draw me here. [_Exit._]SCENE IV. Country near Dunsinane: a Wood in view. Enter with drum and colours Malcolm old Siward and his Son Macduff Menteith Caithness Angus Lennox Ross and Soldiers marching.MALCOLM.Cousins I hope the days are near at handThat chambers will be safe.MENTEITH.We doubt it nothing.SIWARD.What wood is this before us?MENTEITH.The wood of Birnam.MALCOLM.Let every soldier hew him down a boughAnd bear’t before him. Thereby shall we shadowThe numbers of our host and make discoveryErr in report of us.SOLDIERS.It shall be done.SIWARD.We learn no other but the confident tyrantKeeps still in Dunsinane and will endureOur setting down before’t.MALCOLM.’Tis his main hope;For where there is advantage to be givenBoth more and less have given him the revoltAnd none serve with him but constrained thingsWhose hearts are absent too.MACDUFF.Let our just censuresAttend the true event and put we onIndustrious soldiership.SIWARD.The time approachesThat will with due decision make us knowWhat we shall say we have and what we owe.Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relateBut certain issue strokes must arbitrate;Towards which advance the war. [_Exeunt marching._]SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle. Enter with drum and colours Macbeth Seyton and Soldiers.MACBETH.Hang out our banners on the outward walls;The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strengthWill laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lieTill famine and the ague eat them up.Were they not forc’d with those that should be oursWe might have met them dareful beard to beardAnd beat them backward home. [_A cry of women within._]What is that noise?SEYTON.It is the cry of women my good lord. [_Exit._]MACBETH.I have almost forgot the taste of fears.The time has been my senses would have cool’dTo hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hairWould at a dismal treatise rouse and stirAs life were in’t. I have supp’d full with horrors;Direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughtsCannot once start me. Enter Seyton.Wherefore was that cry?SEYTON.The Queen my lord is dead.MACBETH.She should have died hereafter.There would have been a time for such a word.Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrowCreeps in this petty pace from day to dayTo the last syllable of recorded time;And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death. Out out brief candle!Life’s but a walking shadow; a poor playerThat struts and frets his hour upon the stageAnd then is heard no more: it is a taleTold by an idiot full of sound and furySignifying nothing. Enter a Messenger.Thou com’st to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.MESSENGER.Gracious my lordI should report that which I say I sawBut know not how to do’t.MACBETH.Well say sir.MESSENGER.As I did stand my watch upon the hillI look’d toward Birnam and anon methoughtThe wood began to move.MACBETH.Liar and slave!MESSENGER.Let me endure your wrath if’t be not so.Within this three mile may you see it coming;I say a moving grove.MACBETH.If thou speak’st falseUpon the next tree shalt thou hang aliveTill famine cling thee: if thy speech be soothI care not if thou dost for me as much.—I pull in resolution; and beginTo doubt th’ equivocation of the fiendThat lies like truth. “Fear not till Birnam woodDo come to Dunsinane;” and now a woodComes toward Dunsinane.—Arm arm and out!—If this which he avouches does appearThere is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.I ’gin to be aweary of the sunAnd wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now undone.—Ring the alarum bell!—Blow wind! come wrack!At least we’ll die with harness on our back. [_Exeunt._]SCENE VI. The same. A Plain before the Castle. Enter with drum and colours Malcolm old Siward Macduff and their Army with boughs.MALCOLM.Now near enough. Your leafy screens throw downAnd show like those you are.—You worthy uncleShall with my cousin your right noble sonLead our first battle: worthy Macduff and weShall take upon’s what else remains to doAccording to our order.SIWARD.Fare you well.—Do we but find the tyrant’s power tonightLet us be beaten if we cannot fight.MACDUFF.Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breathThose clamorous harbingers of blood and death. [_Exeunt._]SCENE VII. The same. Another part of the Plain. Alarums. Enter Macbeth.MACBETH.They have tied me to a stake. I cannot flyBut bear-like I must fight the course.—What’s heThat was not born of woman? Such a oneAm I to fear or none. Enter young Siward.YOUNG SIWARD.What is thy name?MACBETH.Thou’lt be afraid to hear it.YOUNG SIWARD.No; though thou call’st thyself a hotter nameThan any is in hell.MACBETH.My name’s Macbeth.YOUNG SIWARD.The devil himself could not pronounce a titleMore hateful to mine ear.MACBETH.No nor more fearful.YOUNG SIWARD.Thou liest abhorred tyrant. With my swordI’ll prove the lie thou speak’st. [_They fight and young Siward is slain._]MACBETH.Thou wast born of woman.But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scornBrandish’d by man that’s of a woman born. [_Exit._] Alarums. Enter Macduff.MACDUFF.That way the noise is.—Tyrant show thy face!If thou be’st slain and with no stroke of mineMy wife and children’s ghosts will haunt me still.I cannot strike at wretched kerns whose armsAre hired to bear their staves. Either thou MacbethOr else my sword with an unbatter’d edgeI sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;By this great clatter one of greatest noteSeems bruited. Let me find him Fortune!And more I beg not. [_Exit. Alarums._] Enter Malcolm and old Siward.SIWARD.This way my lord;—the castle’s gently render’d:The tyrant’s people on both sides do fight;The noble thanes do bravely in the warThe day almost itself professes yoursAnd little is to do.MALCOLM.We have met with foesThat strike beside us.SIWARD.Enter sir the castle. [_Exeunt. Alarums._]SCENE VIII. The same. Another part of the field. Enter Macbeth.MACBETH.Why should I play the Roman fool and dieOn mine own sword? whiles I see lives the gashesDo better upon them. Enter Macduff.MACDUFF.Turn hell-hound turn!MACBETH.Of all men else I have avoided thee:But get thee back; my soul is too much charg’dWith blood of thine already.MACDUFF.I have no words;My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villainThan terms can give thee out! [_They fight._]MACBETH.Thou losest labour:As easy mayst thou the intrenchant airWith thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;I bear a charmed life which must not yieldTo one of woman born.MACDUFF.Despair thy charm;And let the angel whom thou still hast serv’dTell thee Macduff was from his mother’s wombUntimely ripp’d.MACBETH.Accursed be that tongue that tells me soFor it hath cow’d my better part of man!And be these juggling fiends no more believ’dThat palter with us in a double sense;That keep the word of promise to our earAnd break it to our hope!—I’ll not fight with thee.MACDUFF.Then yield thee cowardAnd live to be the show and gaze o’ th’ time.We’ll have thee as our rarer monsters arePainted upon a pole and underwrit“Here may you see the tyrant.”MACBETH.I will not yieldTo kiss the ground before young Malcolm’s feetAnd to be baited with the rabble’s curse.Though Birnam wood be come to DunsinaneAnd thou oppos’d being of no woman bornYet I will try the last. Before my bodyI throw my warlike shield: lay on Macduff;And damn’d be him that first cries “Hold enough!” [_Exeunt fighting. Alarums._] Retreat. Flourish. Enter with drum and colours Malcolm old Siward Ross Thanes and Soldiers.MALCOLM.I would the friends we miss were safe arriv’d.SIWARD.Some must go off; and yet by these I seeSo great a day as this is cheaply bought.MALCOLM.Macduff is missing and your noble son.ROSS.Your son my lord has paid a soldier’s debt:He only liv’d but till he was a man;The which no sooner had his prowess confirm’dIn the unshrinking station where he foughtBut like a man he died.SIWARD.Then he is dead?FLEANCE.Ay and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrowMust not be measur’d by his worth for thenIt hath no end.SIWARD.Had he his hurts before?ROSS.Ay on the front.SIWARD.Why then God’s soldier be he!Had I as many sons as I have hairsI would not wish them to a fairer death:And so his knell is knoll’d.MALCOLM.He’s worth more sorrowAnd that I’ll spend for him.SIWARD.He’s worth no more.They say he parted well and paid his score:And so God be with him!—Here comes newer comfort. Enter Macduff with Macbeth’s head.MACDUFF.Hail King for so thou art. Behold where standsTh’ usurper’s cursed head: the time is free.I see thee compass’d with thy kingdom’s pearlThat speak my salutation in their minds;Whose voices I desire aloud with mine—Hail King of Scotland!ALL.Hail King of Scotland! [_Flourish._]MALCOLM.We shall not spend a large expense of timeBefore we reckon with your several lovesAnd make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmenHenceforth be earls the first that ever ScotlandIn such an honour nam’d. What’s more to doWhich would be planted newly with the time—As calling home our exil’d friends abroadThat fled the snares of watchful tyranny;Producing forth the cruel ministersOf this dead butcher and his fiend-like queenWho as ’tis thought by self and violent handsTook off her life;—this and what needful elseThat calls upon us by the grace of GraceWe will perform in measure time and place.So thanks to all at once and to each oneWhom we invite to see us crown’d at Scone.

    "El \"stemming\" es otro paso en el análisis de textos para la normalización a nivel lingüístico. El proceso de stemming sustituye una palabra por su raíz. Elimina los prefijos y sufijos. Por ejemplo, la palabra \"connect\" es la raíz de \"connecting\", \"connected\" y \"connection\". Todas las palabras mencionadas tienen una raíz común: connect. Estas diferencias entre las grafías de las palabras dificultan el análisis de los datos del texto.\n",
    "\n",
    "La lematización es otro tipo de normalización del léxico, que convierte una palabra en su raíz. Está estrechamente relacionada con la stemming. La principal diferencia es que la lematización tiene en cuenta el contexto de la palabra mientras se realiza la normalización, pero el stemmer no tiene en cuenta el conocimiento contextual de la palabra. La lematización es más sofisticada que el stemmer. Por ejemplo, la palabra \"gansos\" se lematiza como \"ganso\". La lematización reduce las palabras a su lema válido utilizando un diccionario. La lematización tiene en cuenta la parte de la oración cercana a las palabras para la normalización; por eso es difícil de implementar y más lenta, mientras que los stemmers son más fáciles de implementar y más rápidos, pero con menos precisión."
